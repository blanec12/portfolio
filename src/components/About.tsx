                I first discovered my love for computer science while working
                toward my Bachelor's degree at SHSU. It was here that I learned
                the fundamentals of computing, networking, programming and the
                like. During my studies my mind was filled with endless
                possiblities as I was introduced to technologies/frameworks to
                add to my arsenal. Although my studies may be done at SHSU, I am
                striving every day to learn more and improve my craft. Tech
                moves fast so we must too!

                Following graduation, I was offered a helpdesk position
                Portacool, LLC. I jumped at this opportunity as it was close to
                home and seemed like as good a time as any to broaden my
                skillset and learn how things actually worked in a production
                environment.

                <br />
                It wasn't long before I transitioned away from helpdesk and
                became the primary source of reporting for upper management. In
                this role I became very well versed in technologies such as SQL,
                SAP Crystal Reports, Tableau, and PowerBi, just to name a few.

                Shortly thereafter, the company decided to move to a new ERP
                system. The system they settled on was Acumatica ERP. It was
                this decision that opened the door to me being able to finally
                use my passion for programming to help the company. I got
                aquainted with C# and .NET, then got to work customizing our ERP
                based on the companies needs. I now have several customization
                projects under my belt that range from extending/improving
                existing functionality, to building entirely custom solutions to
                challenges we have faced.
